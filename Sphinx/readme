Demo Steps

create a new package or clone an existing one

in the root of the package, run "sphinx-quickstart"
- follow the prompts for the quickstart application
- you may want to say yes to the following, they seem pretty slick
  - auto-doc
  - doctest
  - viewcode
  - githubpages

Once the sphinx-quickstart is complete, it's time to run the automatic documentation tool sphinx-apidoc
- ex: sphinx-apidoc -o source ../code

When the sphinx-apidoc command finishes, link the modules.rst file it generated in the index.rst. Add any additional rst files to the index or and documentation you'ld like to write directly in index.rst.
- under the toctree in index.rst add "source/modules"

We're almost done, just a bit more to configure in conf.py
- set "sphinx_rtd_theme" around line 92

Run the makefile command to build the documentation
- make html
- open -a firefox _build/html/index.html
